## Description

- The final Udacity front-end web development Advanced program project.
- build a web app that lets a user play the Would You Rather? game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?.
- Users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they havenâ€™t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

The provided file [`_DATA.js`](src/data/_DATA.js) a fake database and contains methods that let you access the data and another provided [`README.md`](src/data/README.md) file contains the explanation of how to use methods inside [`_DATA.js`] that you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend part.
